# Quill Dashboard

[Quill](https://quill.co/) allows SaaS companies to build dashboards with little code.

This is a lightweight version of Quill where React frontend has `dashboards` composed of `charts`.

Backend is written in `Python/Flask` and data is stored in `supabase` which is `postgreSQL` behind the scenes and interfaced with a simple `supabase url` and `supabase API key`


# Run backend

#### `cd into pythonBackend` => `pip install requirements.txt` and run `python3 app.py`


# Run frontend

#### `cd into react-frontend` 

#### install the node_modules using `npm install`

#### start the React frontend with `npm start`
